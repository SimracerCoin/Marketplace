# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

#### Dapp wallet access HOWTO
use allow.json to have a whitelist of allowed wallets
remove REACT_APP_ALLOW_ALL_WALLETS property, or set it to "false" on the .env file
This way only whitelisted address will have access

In order to allow all wallets and ignore the file (so no whitelist) set REACT_APP_ALLOW_ALL_WALLETS to "true"

### Using Infura IPFS HOWTO
In order to connect to IPFS, Infura requires Authorization HTTP header for all requests
https://docs.infura.io/infura/networks/ipfs/how-to/authenticate-requests
The following keys must be provided on the client .env file (taken from the project dashboard):
REACT_APP_INFURA_IPFS_PROJECT_ID
REACT_APP_INFURA_IPFS_API_SECRET
